This is a javascript visualization using the p5 library based on a few different youtube episodes of Daniel Shiffman's coding train.

It's slightly interactive, in that when you click on the canvas, the tree grows and the boids flee the click location. It's not really at the point where I'd call it either a simulation or a game... just a bit of preactice to explore the ideas from the episodes.

Adjustments to the tree angle only apply to the next branch, existing branches stay. This allows you to set a different angle for each branch level. To reset your tree, refresh the page.
